# Convex cost reduction release evidence

## Scope

The approved plan covers subscription scope, lightweight paginated product reads,
incremental health/sourcing summaries, CJ scheduling, webhook retention, Nexx
preview jobs, and regression/operational guidance. No phase is considered complete
solely because a narrower test passes.

## Phase 0 baseline

- Repository: `monicaestimon-ctrl/louiemae2`; default branch: `main`.
- Remote baseline: `ce92fc33643d231e50c97015b92433096009779d` (PR 127).
- GitHub CI for this commit succeeded, including the production Convex deploy job.
- Original local checkout is older and has extensive unrelated uncommitted work.
  Implementation uses an isolated managed worktree based on remote main.
- Louie Mae production deployment identified in the account: `diligent-jay-261`.
- Nexx repository identified: `monicafernii97-cmd/nexx-app`; its original checkout
  also has uncommitted work and must be preserved.
- Baseline September usage and invoice evidence are in the approved plan. Runtime
  measurements and production availability still need revalidation before claiming
  an improvement in live costs.

## PR 1: scope authenticated catalog subscriptions

Private catalog demand is registered by mounted admin
consumers rather than enabled for every authenticated visitor. Server authorization
and endpoint contracts remain unchanged. Public browsing uses the public catalog.
Multiple consumers and React StrictMode cleanup are covered by focused tests.

Local validation: 73 test files / 487 tests passed, frontend and strict Convex
type checks passed, lint passed with warnings, production build and client-secret
verification passed. Tests cover subscription lifecycle, multiple consumers,
StrictMode, public browsing after login, and unauthenticated requests.

Pending: review, merge, frontend deployment verification, and production
observations. All later phases remain pending.
